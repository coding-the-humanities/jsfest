Humanize Code
=============

The world of programming education is currently exploding. This talk
will take a deep dive into the approach-agnostic theoretical and
pedagogical challenges of teaching programming and computer science
(mainly: abstraction), as well as explain the choices that we make in
order to tackle these challenge in our program 'Coding the Humanities'.

Examples from multiple disciplines will identify the problem of 
teaching abstraction as a ubiquitous demand across nearly every domain, 
and align the issues of creativity and critical thinking in the humanities 
with issues in computer science. 

In programming education, abstraction has long been mistaken as the
prerogative of mathematicians. Abstraction, however, is a feature of
every linguistic system. The fact that humanities' students are trained
in mastering languages often makes them excellent programmers. This
fact by now has been acknowled by the software industry, but is almost
completely ignored by the education system. Here coding is still located
in the STEM departments and taught as a computational skill.

'Coding the Humanities' is an open source curriculum and platform that
helps humanities students to develop tools and skills to do research
through coding. At the end of our presentation, we will look into the
specifics of our curriculum and the custom tools that we are developing
to achieve this. We will explain why we made some unorthodox choices -
such as introducing students to coding through 'web components' - and
tell about our expeiences with these choices so far.
