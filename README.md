Humanize Code
=============

The world of programming education is currently exploding. This talk
will take a deep dive into the approach-agnostic theoretical and
pedagogical challenges of teaching programming and computer science
(mainly: abstraction), as well as explain the choices that we make in
order to tackle these challenge in our program 'Coding the Humanities'.

Examples from multiple disciplines will identify the problem of 
teaching abstraction as a ubiquitous demand across nearly every domain, 
and align the issues of creativity and critical thinking in the humanities 
with issues in computer science. 

In programming education, abstraction has long been mistaken as the
prerogative of mathematicians. Abstraction, however, is a feature of
every linguistic system. The fact that humanities' students are trained
in mastering languages often makes them excellent programmers. This
fact by now has been acknowled by the software industry, but is almost
completely ignored by the education system. Here coding is still located
in the STEM departments and taught as a computational skill.

To illustrate this, we will talk about an unconventional choice that
we made teaching programming to absolute beginners in the 'Coding the
Humanities' course. Our entire curriculum is built around webcomponents. We
believe that this has the following advantages:

1. Declarative code is easier to understand and reason about.

2. Modularization stimulates collaboration.

3. Encapsulation enforces best practices

4. Complex concepts (recursion, looping, enumeration, etc.) can be
introduced relatively late in the curriculum.

5. Most importantly, webcomponents allow students to focus on concrete
questions rather than technical implementation.
